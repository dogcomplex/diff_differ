# Diff Differ

Comparing various image diff algorithms

Repo slapped together mostly with automated Cursor to try out and recursively test/compare/verify various "diff" algorithms for image comparison.  We essentially want to be able to dependably document the difference between two screenshots in various environments and recreate the missing screenshot1 screenshot2 or diff image in either case.  Might need to do two diff images as a format (forward and backward) but idk.   Example here is the game "Crafter".

# TODO 

- [ ] probably import a bunch of confirmed-working diff algs from awesome-diff or something.  These were largely made to explore automated programming tools
